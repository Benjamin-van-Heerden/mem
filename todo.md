- Check if mem merge into main
"All branches (dev, test, main) are now at the same commit."
is accurate
e.g. dev may be many commits ahead, the point is the test and main be at the same commit
- add hints after mem merge to indicate mem merge into test is possible
- figure out why building sync plan takes so long
- `mem log` does not show "When on active spec vs when on normal" *while no active spec* - there is therefore no CTA to add commit push
