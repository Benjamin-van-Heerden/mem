# WORKTREE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Configure paths that should be symlinked into worktrees
# This is useful for shared data that shouldn't be duplicated across worktrees
# (e.g., vector databases, caches, large files)

[worktree]
# Paths relative to project root that will be symlinked into worktrees
# When `mem spec assign` creates a worktree, these paths will be symlinked
# from the main repo to the worktree instead of being copied.
#
# This is optional. If you don't want any symlinks, leave it as an empty list.
#
# Example:
# symlink_paths = [
#     ".mem/docs/data",    # Vector DB for document search
#     "node_modules",      # Large dependency directory
# ]
symlink_paths = []
