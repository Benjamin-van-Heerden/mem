After the WORKTREE READY section in spec assign, add a hint showing how to create tasks for the spec, e.g.: mem task new 'title' 'description'

## Completion Notes

Updated spec new to show task creation as step 3 before assignment. Updated spec assign to commit and push all .mem/ changes before creating worktree, ensuring tasks created in main repo are available in the new branch.
